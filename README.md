## What is Rhino?  

**Rhino** (Rhinoceros 3D) is a comprehensive **3D modeling and CAD platform** developed by McNeel, bringing professional-grade surface creation and solid modeling to the macOS ecosystem. Designed for both creativity and precision, Rhino enables users to craft intricate 3D forms with accuracy that rivals engineering software.  

The core of Rhino’s power lies in its **NURBS-based modeling system**, which represents curves and surfaces with mathematical precision. This allows for seamless manipulation of even the most complex geometries — from organic product shapes to architectural structures.  

On macOS, Rhino takes advantage of **Apple Silicon performance and Metal graphics acceleration**, ensuring smooth viewport rendering and rapid computation. Its clean, native interface feels perfectly at home on macOS, blending advanced functionality with ease of use.  

Rhino also includes **Grasshopper**, a built-in parametric design engine that lets users automate modeling through visual scripting — a must-have for architectural and generative design workflows.  

### Why Rhino?  

* **Professional 3D modeling tools** – perfect for industrial design, architecture, and product engineering.  
* **Accurate NURBS modeling** – unmatched precision for surfaces, solids, and curves.  
* **Built-in Grasshopper** – parametric modeling and automation inside Rhino.  
* **Cross-format compatibility** – works with DWG, STEP, OBJ, STL, and more.  
* **Optimized for Apple Silicon** – runs natively on M1, M2, and M3 chips.  
* **Modern macOS interface** – fast, clean, and intuitive design experience.  

Rhino Mac is trusted by professionals who need reliability, precision, and creative freedom — all within a Mac-native environment.
